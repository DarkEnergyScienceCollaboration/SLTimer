# SLTimer

Time delay measurement from LSST light curves.

In the first instance (DC1), SLTimer will be a simple python class for calling community-developed time delay estimation algorithms, to enable early testing of DM-produced light curves in the [Twinkles project](https://github.com/DarkEnergyScienceCollaboration/Twinkles).

## Set-up
From bash
```
$ source <SLTimer install directory>/setup/setup.sh
```

## Demo

Placeholder:
```
    python sltimer/SLTimer.py
```
