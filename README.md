[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DarkEnergyScienceCollaboration/SLTimer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DarkEnergyScienceCollaboration/SLTimer)[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/DarkEnergyScienceCollaboration/SLTimer/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/DarkEnergyScienceCollaboration/SLTimer?branch=master)

Time delay measurement from LSST light curves.

In the first instance (DC1), SLTimer will be a simple python class for calling community-developed time delay estimation algorithms, to enable early testing of DM-produced light curves in the [Twinkles project](https://github.com/DarkEnergyScienceCollaboration/Twinkles).
